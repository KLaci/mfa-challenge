# MFA Challenge

This project is a demo for Supabase-powered authentication login with MFA.

### Usage

Ensure that Deno is installed: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then, start the project:

```
deno task start
```

### How to Invite a New User?

Log in to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vepoznsqsjcrcbepcwjd/auth/users, click on the 'Add User' button and then on the 'Send Invitation' button. If you do not have access to the Supabase project, feel free to contact me at laszlo.kiss27@gmail.com.

### Notes

The project was created for demonstration purposes and is not intended to be used in production in its current form. Before transitioning into production, I advise considering the following questions:

- Add a proper configuration management system for the project.
- Include Captcha protection for the login process.
- Evaluate whether a cloud-based Supabase or an on-premise version is more suitable for the project.

If you encounter any questions or issues while running the product, feel free to contact me at laszlo.kiss27@gmail.com.
